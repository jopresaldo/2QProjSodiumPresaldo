      <h3>
          The coronavirus has been lingering for nearly 2 years now. Even when we have vaccines to help stop the spread, people seem to have misunderstood or
          have been provided with incorrect information about COVID. <img src = "../images/index.jpg" alt="COVID Virus" style = "float: right;">This website will counter the pandemic-like spread of misinformation, as this website has 
          the sole purpose of providing the public with correct, accurate, and up-to-date information about the coronavirus, the pandemic, and its vaccines. 
      </h3>

      <h3>
          Once you start, a questionnaire will be given and you must answer each question truthfully. These will decide what type of information and data is
          most appropriate for the user. Data may be updated in the future to be more accurate and up-to-date. Sources for the data shown here are in the "About"
          tab.
